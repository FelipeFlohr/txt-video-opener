## FAQ

1. Q: Why did you make this?
- A: Well, my friends and I decided to "do a [Watch2Gether](https://w2g.tv/)", but there were a lot of Facebook videos (almost 40), and the Facebook player runs kinda clunky on Watch2Gether, so I decided to open every video individually but it was a lot time-consuming. So, today I decided to code this to make things a bit easier :)

2. Q: I found a bug, If I report, would you fix it?
- A: Well, maybe. I mean, depends on the kind of bug you found. Also, as I said on the previous question: I'm currently learning Java, so I probably will not fix this bug.
