# .txt Video Opener

A very simple webpage of mine where you can load a .txt containing URLs for social media videos.

## How to use:
All you need to do is to create a .txt file containing links for videos. Example:
```
url1
url2
url3
url4
```
After, you will need to load the .txt file pressing the "Click me!" input label.

The "video number" indicates the current video you are iterating on. If you click the "Open link" button, a new tab will be opened with the respective URL on.

## FAQ

1. Q: Why did you make this?
- A: Well, my friends and I decided to "do a [Watch2Gether](https://w2g.tv/)", but there were a lot of Facebook videos (almost 40), and the Facebook player runs kinda clunky on Watch2Gether, so I decided to open every video individually but it was a lot time-consuming. So, today I decided to code this to make things easier :)

2. Q: Holy crap, this code looks like trash, won't you fix it?
- A: Yes, I know. This code is far way from being good, since I don't know a single thing about web development. I'm currently learning Java, so maybe in the future I'll try to fix this, or make a better version, idk.

3. Q: I found a bug, If I report, would you fix it?
- A: Well, maybe. I mean, depends on the kind of bug you found. Also, as I said on the previous question: I'm currently learning Java, so I probably will not fix this bug.
